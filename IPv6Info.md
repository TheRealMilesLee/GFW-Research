# The basics of IPv6
A brand new protocol from scratch - totally different from the IPV4

## Current problem with IPV4

IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, which allows for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
The solution to this is simple, just using NAT on each level could significantly solve
this problem. However, as the demand for internet-connected devices continues to grow,
NAT alone cannot address the fundamental issue of limited IPv4 address space.

The main problem with NAT lies in its performance issues and scalability, as well as
the fact that NAT networks can leave certain gaming services with limited and disconnected
connections. Because of its configurability and controllability, carrier-grade NAT has been
deployed on a large scale in China.

However, as mentioned earlier, the problem of address exhaustion remains unresolved.
Using NAT only temporarily expands the IP address pool like caching, but it is not a permanent
solution. With the massive popularity of smart homes in recent years, the IPv4 address problem
has become a priority again. This time the IPv6 protocol is needed to save the day.
